# SUMMARY
James Dunse discusses AI's role in application security at Lascon, sharing insights and lessons learned from his experiences.

# IDEAS:
- Lascon maintains high energy throughout the event, fostering community engagement and participation.
- Austin's growth has led to increased security content and conferences in the area.
- Driver Security focuses on identifying risks in code changes before they become issues.
- Traditional security methods rely heavily on pattern matching, which can be limiting.
- Understanding behaviors, rather than just patterns, can enhance application security analysis.
- LLMs (Large Language Models) must be chosen carefully for specific tasks in security.
- Effective questioning is key to extracting valuable insights from LLMs during analysis.
- Combining deterministic and probabilistic methodologies can improve security outcomes.
- Contextual security analysis considers the surrounding context of code changes for better insights.
- AI can help summarize complex behaviors and provide clearer security analysis.
- The shift to AI in security mirrors the earlier transition to cloud operations.
- Many organizations face chronic understaffing in their security teams, affecting productivity.
- Developers often batch commits to avoid lengthy security checks, slowing down processes.
- Security teams need to understand the context of application changes to assess risks effectively.
- AI tools can aid in threat modeling, enriching developers' understanding of vulnerabilities.
- Open-source tools like Fabric are valuable for enhancing security practices in development.
- LLMs excel at summarizing and extracting information from complex datasets.
- Security's relationship with developers needs to be collaborative for effective risk management.
- Contextual security analysis can provide insights beyond mere code inspection.
- The future of security will increasingly integrate AI to enhance operational efficiency.
- Implementing AI in security should focus on areas with the highest impact on efficiency.

# INSIGHTS:
- Community engagement at conferences can significantly enhance learning and networking opportunities.
- Understanding the context of code changes is crucial for effective application security analysis.
- AI has the potential to transform security practices, similar to the impact of cloud technologies.
- Security tools should facilitate collaboration rather than create bottlenecks in development workflows.
- Patterns alone are insufficient; behaviors and contexts provide deeper insights into security vulnerabilities.
- Effective use of LLMs requires precise prompting and context to yield valuable results.
- The security landscape is evolving, necessitating continuous adaptation to emerging technologies and methodologies.
- Developer empathy is essential for successful integration of security practices into the software development lifecycle.
