# SUMMARY
The speaker discusses client-side attacks on mobile, web, and desktop apps, highlighting security measures and attack categorization frameworks.

# IDEAS:
- The mobile app market is vast, with 5 million apps generating nearly a trillion dollars in revenue.
- Every app serves as a potential attack vector due to accessible backend instructions.
- Anonymized attack data provides insight into real-world threats on client-side applications.
- The Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) categorizes seven critical security controls for apps.
- Client-side security challenges arise from the control users have over downloaded apps.
- Rooted or jailbroken devices present significant risks for application security.
- Obfuscation techniques make reverse engineering apps more difficult for attackers.
- Dynamic analysis resistance is crucial to prevent app manipulation during runtime.
- Many applications are attacked, yet the percentage of successful attacks remains low.
- The trend of increasing attacks correlates with the rise of cryptocurrency and ransomware.
- AI democratizes the creation of malware, making it accessible to less experienced threat actors.
- The Digital Markets Act may increase attacks on iOS apps by allowing third-party stores.
- The gaming industry faces unique security challenges due to user motivations beyond financial gain.
- Apps with fewer users can experience just as many attacks as popular ones.
- Compliance with security measures is crucial for maintaining customer trust and business viability.
- Security through obscurity can be a component of a larger security strategy when applied correctly.

# INSIGHTS:
- An expansive app ecosystem creates numerous vulnerabilities that require constant vigilance from security engineers.
- User control over apps complicates security, necessitating robust protective measures against unauthorized access.
- Understanding attack vectors helps in prioritizing security investments and gaining budgetary support.
- The efficacy of security measures can be gauged through the frequency and type of attacks observed.
- Collaborating with developers on security practices is essential for creating resilient applications.
- The balance between rapid app development and security measures poses a challenge for organizations.
- Contextualizing attack data in terms of business risk is vital for securing organizational support for security.
- Evolving attack methods highlight the need for continuous adaptation in security practices.
- Engaging with frameworks like MASVS enhances the understanding and implementation of security controls.
- Security professionals must advocate for comprehensive security education among developers to mitigate risks.

# QUOTES:
- "It's kind of an app happy world."
- "Every single one of those apps... has some sort of instruction... to access a backend server."
- "If you're a curious user, it can be fun... but obviously, if you're a company... you have your work cut out for you."
- "The problem is... we have no control over how people use those apps."
- "It only takes one successful attack for a breach to occur."
- "You want to at least be as high as the average to see the attacks."
- "It's a litigious Society."
- "In the case of a bank, you want to remove some functionality behind transferring money."
- "Obfuscation techniques make it harder for threat actors to reverse engineer."
- "You can't apply too much obfuscation from a security perspective."
- "Security through obscurity can be a component of a larger security strategy."
- "The more popular the app, the more attacks we would see... it's actually quite weak."
- "If you want to convince the powers that be, you need to show the data."
- "Democratization of attacks makes it easier to create malware."
- "The Digital Markets Act will begin to see more attacks on the iOS side."
- "You have to figure out where to put the hooks in security."

# HABITS:
- Regularly anonymize and aggregate attack data for better security insights and presentations.
- Incorporate resilience controls in app development to combat potential threats effectively.
- Engage developers in security training to enhance awareness of vulnerabilities and protective measures.
- Implement obfuscation techniques at the build stage to enhance code security.
- Maintain a balance between security measures and app performance for optimal user experience.
- Use threat intelligence to continuously update and improve security protocols.
- Regularly review and adjust security measures in response to evolving attack methods.
- Establish clear communication between security teams and developers to ensure effective collaboration.
- Advocate for comprehensive security education among developers within organizations.
- Analyze trends in attack data to inform future security investments and strategies.

# FACTS:
- Nearly a trillion dollars in revenue is generated by mobile apps in 2024.
- There are 52,000 new apps added monthly to the Play Store.
- 65% of apps were attacked within a four-week period in early 2024.
- Attacks on apps increased from 55% to 65% over three years.
- The MASVS is a framework for mobile application security with seven critical controls.
- The use of AI in malware creation is democratizing access for less experienced threat actors.
- The Digital Markets Act in Europe may increase iOS app vulnerabilities.
- Rooted devices represent a significant risk for application security.
- The banking sector experiences unique challenges related to user access and app functionality.
- Obfuscation can deter static analysis but is not a foolproof solution against attacks.
- Many apps are attacked regardless of their popularity or user base size.
- Compliance with security standards can help maintain customer trust and business viability.
- Security professionals must adapt to new threats and continuously evolve their practices.
- Threat intelligence can help organizations understand the landscape of potential attacks.
- The average number of attacks seen by various organizations can vary significantly.
- Gaming apps face unique security challenges due to user motivations beyond financial incentives.
