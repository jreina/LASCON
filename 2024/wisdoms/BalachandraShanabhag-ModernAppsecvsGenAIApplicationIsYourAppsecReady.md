# SUMMARY
The speaker discusses the evolution of modern applications versus generative applications, focusing on security challenges and mitigation strategies for AI-driven software.

# IDEAS:
- Generative applications emerged significantly after 2020, reshaping how software is developed and secured.
- ChatGPT's initial capabilities appeared magical, but limitations and security issues soon became evident.
- Previous software transformations included cloud adoption, microservices, and virtualization, leading to today's generative application wave.
- The rapid adoption of generative applications necessitated immediate changes in security practices across the software development lifecycle.
- The speaker faced challenges in securing applications without prior machine learning or NLP knowledge.
- Existing frameworks, such as OWASP's LLM top 10, help secure generative applications effectively.
- The architecture of generative applications involves infrastructure, foundational models, and the application layer.
- Prompt injections are a significant security threat, simplifying the attack process for malicious users.
- Users must validate inputs to prevent prompt injection, similar to traditional input validation methods.
- Generative models often rely on large datasets, requiring careful consideration of data security and supply chain risks.
- Denial of service attacks can also target generative models, necessitating specific mitigation strategies.
- Sensitive information disclosure remains a risk, especially with models trained on vast datasets.
- Code generated by AI tools often contains security vulnerabilities, necessitating human oversight and reviews.
- Developers must be trained to recognize and reject obscure or insecure code from AI-generated outputs.
- Governance frameworks are essential for managing the use of AI in code generation and security.
- Continuous monitoring and auditing of AI-generated code is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities.
- Generative applications should implement modern security practices to address unique threats and risks.
- Human oversight, including a "human in the loop" approach, can mitigate risks associated with generative applications.
- Developers must prioritize thorough testing of AI-generated code before deployment.
- Collaboration between developers and AI tools can enhance productivity but requires careful security considerations.
- Organizations should actively seek out modern security tools to protect against emerging threats related to generative applications.

# INSIGHTS:
