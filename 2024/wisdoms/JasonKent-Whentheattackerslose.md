# QUOTES:
- "This is one of the greatest successes I've had in my career because I stopped an actual criminal."
- "I had an explosion in the basement of my house; house burned pretty bad."
- "The biggest benefit is that you can log into all of your financial systems with one username and password."
- "You never keep all the money in your checking account; you put it in your savings account."
- "If you're building systems that build aggregation like this, you should understand the other part of it."
- "The traffic flow allows for people to use API endpoints in ways that you wouldn't expect."
- "You have to understand the roles for the follow-on channel that you're going to drop this in."
- "Bots have trouble reading their email; they have to do a bunch of different things."
- "Bad actors are lazy; they don't have to be good if they win."
- "Data science is going to help you understand things much more easily than picking through your web logs."
- "If you look at the origin organization, no one at home is using AWS as the way they surf the web."
- "It's not really like that anymore, but sort of it is; it's happening on a transaction-by-transaction basis."
- "Understanding how they move through your environment allows you to say, 'Aha, that's a bad transaction.'"
- "If an aggregator is under attack load, they should be sending signals to all affected banks."
- "You need to look at the email addresses and understand sort of are they good or bad."

# HABITS:

- Educate family about financial safety, particularly regarding using debit versus credit cards.
- Implement multi-factor authentication on all financial accounts to enhance security.
- Regularly review and update security measures to adapt to evolving threats.
- Maintain communication with financial institutions about security practices and potential vulnerabilities.
- Use machine learning tools to analyze user behavior and detect anomalies in transactions.
- Track user behavior through applications to understand normal patterns and identify irregularities.
- Avoid sharing sensitive information over unsecured channels to prevent data breaches.
- Conduct routine audits of API endpoints to ensure they adhere to security best practices.
- Encourage responsible usage of technology among peers and family members.
- Share successful security stories to inspire awareness and proactive measures in the community.
- Use strong, unique passwords for different accounts to mitigate credential stuffing risks.
- Stay informed about the latest trends in API security and fraud prevention.
- Recognize and address the patterns of bad actors to improve overall security posture.
- Teach others about the importance of API security and how they can contribute.
- Develop a habit of verifying email addresses during account registrations to reduce bot sign-ups.
