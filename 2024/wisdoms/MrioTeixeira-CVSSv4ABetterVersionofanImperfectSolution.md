- New metrics in CVSs V4 allow for clearer definitions of attack complexity and user interaction types.
- The transition from CVSs V3.1 to V4 aims to improve vulnerability assessment in various user environments.
- Base metrics in CVSs are mandatory, while supplemental metrics provide additional context for vulnerabilities.
- Understanding the differences between vulnerability severity and risk assessment is crucial for effective cybersecurity management.
- Open-source software constitutes 70-90% of modern software solutions, raising concerns about vulnerability prevalence.
- The introduction of a supplemental metrics group in CVSs V4 allows for more contextualized vulnerability information.
- Attack requirements now specify conditions that make exploitation more complex, differentiating them from attack complexity.
- The impact of vulnerabilities can now be assessed on both vulnerable and subsequent systems, enhancing clarity.
- Providers must offer detailed information for accurate scoring to ensure effective vulnerability management practices.
- Collaboration between consumers and providers is essential to achieve better context and scoring accuracy in CVSs.
- Automation in environmental metrics can help organizations maintain up-to-date vulnerability assessments and risk evaluations.
- The lack of adoption of CVSs V4 may stem from organizational maturity and awareness challenges.
- Transparency in vulnerability reporting and scoring can improve trust and accuracy within the cybersecurity community.
- Consensus among stakeholders is necessary for accurate definitions of vulnerability impacts and characteristics.

# INSIGHTS:
- CVSs V4 introduces significant changes that enhance the granularity and accuracy of vulnerability scoring metrics.
- Vulnerability management should incorporate both severity assessments and contextual information for effective risk management.
- The reliance on open-source software increases exposure to vulnerabilities, necessitating robust assessment frameworks.
- Clear definitions of attack parameters in CVSs V4 allow organizations to better prioritize security measures.
- Effective vulnerability assessment requires collaboration and transparency between both providers and consumers of security data.
- Organizations must develop maturity in their vulnerability management processes to facilitate the adoption of CVSs V4.
- Supplemental metrics enhance understanding of vulnerabilities, providing a more comprehensive approach to risk assessment.
- Automation can streamline vulnerability assessments, making them more efficient and less prone to human error.
- The complexity of vulnerabilities necessitates a nuanced approach to scoring, rather than a one-size-fits-all model.
- The evolution of CVSs reflects the need for more sophisticated tools to address the challenges posed by modern cybersecurity threats.

# QUOTES:
- "The systems we consume will always be vulnerable." 
- "CVSs stands for common vulnerabilities current system, a vendor agnostic industry op standard."
- "The idea is that it will convey characteristics and severity of software vulnerability."
- "CVSs V4 aims to improve upon version 3.1 but also introduces more granularity."
- "You can start talking about severity and find a way to sort by severity."
- "Everything was a 9.8; it’s as critical as it gets almost."
- "CVSs is a tool, not an entire solution."
- "Open source constitutes like 70 to 90% of any modern software solution."
- "Lack of adoption stems first from a lack of awareness."
- "You shouldn't be relying on CVSs alone for risk vulnerability assessment."
- "Limited context can be a problem if providers aren’t providing enough information."
- "Scoring should reflect the context and not just the worst-case scenarios."
- "Collaboration with open source communities is essential for effective vulnerability management."
- "Consensus among stakeholders is necessary for accurate definitions of vulnerability impacts."
- "More transparency about vulnerabilities will lead to fairer scores."
- "The more you adopt CVSs, the less it will be a limitation."

# HABITS:
- Regularly assess and prioritize vulnerabilities based on their characteristics and severity.
- Use supplemental metrics to provide additional context for vulnerability assessments.
- Collaborate with teams and stakeholders to improve understanding of vulnerability impacts.
- Automate vulnerability assessments using threat intelligence sources to maintain accuracy.
- Engage with open source communities for better vulnerability management practices.
- Encourage transparency in vulnerability reporting within organizations and teams.
- Maintain an asset management database to track vulnerabilities and their impacts.
- Stay informed about updates and changes in vulnerability scoring standards like CVSs.
- Foster a culture of cybersecurity awareness among team members and stakeholders.
- Continuously improve vulnerability management processes based on lessons learned and evolving threats.
