# SUMMARY
Matt Taro discusses Application Security Posture Management (ASPM), its marketplace overview, and emphasizes its similarities to existing appsec practices.

# IDEAS:
- ASPM is defined by Gartner as managing security signals across software development and deployment.
- AI definitions of ASPM emphasize a holistic approach to managing application security risks.
- The term ASPM may just be a rebranding of existing appsec practices with no new concepts.
- Visibility is crucial in appsec, yet it has been emphasized for over a decade without change.
- ASPM's definitions include risk assessment, prioritization, integration, automation, compliance, and metrics.
- Many appsec concepts are not new; they have been practiced for years but are now relabeled.
- The speaker humorously equates ASPM's introduction to a gold rush mentality among vendors.
- Achieving budget for security initiatives is a core value in the context of ASPM.
- Coverage over depth is emphasized as a better strategy for appsec testing.
- Collecting data is essential to measure trends and demonstrate the value of appsec efforts.
- A single source of truth for application inventory is crucial for effective appsec.
- Understanding ownership of applications is fundamental for prioritizing remediation efforts.
- Empathy in communication with development teams enhances collaboration and understanding in appsec.
- Swapping roles with developers fosters better understanding and relationships between teams.
- ASPM should be approached with a focus on practicality, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- The evolution of pipelines reflects a movement from basic assessments to automated, event-driven processes.
  
# INSIGHTS:
- The introduction of ASPM may signify a skills gap in understanding existing appsec practices.
- Visibility and risk assessment have been critical components of appsec for over a decade.
- Budget discussions are pivotal when introducing new security frameworks like ASPM.
- ASPM appears to offer no revolutionary changes; it largely reiterates established appsec principles.
- Automation is beneficial but should focus on repetitive tasks that do not require human intervention.
- A successful appsec program requires continuous iteration and improvement over time.
- The importance of application inventory cannot be understated in establishing a solid appsec foundation.
- Communication and collaboration across teams can significantly enhance the effectiveness of appsec.
- The value of ASPM is primarily in securing budget and resources for appsec initiatives.
- Appsec professionals should cherry-pick strategies that work best for their organizational context.

# QUOTES:
- "I have come not to praise ASPM but to bury it."
- "I think we were super early mind you, but it doesn't feel all that new to me."
- "You can't measure a trend until you start collecting data."
- "Understanding what your estate is is hugely valuable."
- "Ownership will be a huge fundamental problem."
- "If you can convince your boss that you don't have ASPM enough because Gartner says you need more, then you get some budget."
- "Don't get wrapped around the axle about how that's different."
- "You will have to iterate continually to get this stuff done."
- "Tech is great and I love it but people are the most critical resource."
- "The importance of application inventory cannot be understated in establishing a solid appsec foundation."
- "If you didn't understand that, it's really hard to have the empathy to understand."
- "If you have a list of all the things, you can do prioritization."
- "Automation can be a trap of sexiness and fun stuff to do."
- "You have a better chance to allocate scarce resources."
- "Make friends with the people you interact with your stakeholders."

# HABITS:
- Maintain a Linux laptop for personal use and encourage others to do the same.
- Collect and analyze security data continuously to measure improvement over time.
- Prioritize coverage over depth when assessing application security.
- Automate repetitive tasks to reduce manual effort and increase efficiency.
- Foster open communication and collaboration with development teams regularly.
- Conduct regular inventory assessments to maintain a clear understanding of applications.
- Document ownership of applications to facilitate accountability and prioritization.
- Use visual aids to clarify complex concepts and processes in appsec.
- Regularly assess the effectiveness of tools and processes in your appsec program.
- Engage in role-swapping with development teams to enhance mutual understanding.

# FACTS:
