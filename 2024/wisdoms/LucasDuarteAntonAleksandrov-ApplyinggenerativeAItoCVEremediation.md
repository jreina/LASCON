# SUMMARY
Anton and Lucas from AWS discuss applying generative AI for CVE remediation, addressing the challenges of vulnerability management in organizations.

# IDEAS:
- Generative AI can automate processes in CVE remediation, significantly reducing manual intervention by engineers.
- The number of common vulnerabilities increased by 25% this year, totaling nearly 35,000 vulnerabilities.
- Organizations with over 100 staff see a higher number of critical risk vulnerabilities.
- It takes about 60 days on average to resolve vulnerabilities, which can be exploited in that time.
- Frequent scanning correlates with much faster remediation times in vulnerability management.
- The vulnerability management process is cyclical and labor-intensive, requiring continuous effort from engineers.
- Many organizations lack efficient processes for managing vulnerabilities, leading to delays and risks.
- Generative AI can provide automated pull requests (PRs) for fixing identified vulnerabilities based on templates.
- Contextual learning helps improve the efficiency of generative AI models in vulnerability management tasks.
- The collaboration between AWS services like Inspector and Bedrock enhances vulnerability detection and remediation.
- Utilizing smaller, more focused AI models can be cost-effective while still delivering valuable insights.
- The generative AI solution aims to be lightweight and event-driven, minimizing resource consumption.
- The project is open source, allowing for community collaboration and improvements.
- Integrating multiple security tools can create a more comprehensive vulnerability management approach.
- AI can help prioritize vulnerabilities based on their criticality and impact on applications.
- Injecting contextual data into AI models can enhance their accuracy and relevance in generating solutions.

# INSIGHTS:
- Generative AI streamlines CVE remediation by automating repetitive tasks and reducing human error.
- The rising number of vulnerabilities necessitates proactive vulnerability management to maintain security.
- Continuous integration and scanning are essential for timely detection and resolution of vulnerabilities.
- Contextual learning and prompt engineering significantly enhance the performance of AI models in specific tasks.
- Open-source solutions allow for flexibility and community-driven enhancements in vulnerability management.
- Automated PR generation can significantly reduce the time taken to remediate vulnerabilities in applications.
- Collaboration between different AI models can lead to better decision-making in vulnerability assessment.
- A proactive security posture requires organizations to address vulnerabilities as soon as they are identified.
- The integration of various security tools can create a holistic approach to application safety and security.
- Future-ready security solutions must evolve continuously to adapt to new threats and vulnerabilities.

# QUOTES:

- "We want to be proactive in vulnerability management."
- "The solution needs to feel like an integral part of what you already have."
- "We need to build a prompt in a way that the model will understand."
- "This model is not shy about saying I don’t know."
- "Everything you see here today will have QR codes at the very end."
- "This is a solution, not a product."
- "Using generative AI can significantly reduce manual intervention."
- "The project is open source, allowing for community collaboration."
- "We need to address vulnerabilities as soon as they are identified."
- "Our goal is to provide a more automated way of vulnerability management."
- "Contextual learning helps improve the efficiency of AI models."
- "This is a critical piece of what we do in security."
