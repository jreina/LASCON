- "You have to understand how things are connected to defend them."
- "Many cloud breaches stem from misconfigured identities."
- "Threat modeling must include identity management considerations."
- "Using automation can streamline identity governance."
- "We have to apply the rigor we need to reduce risk."
- "The identity controls can be context-driven and flexible."
- "Identity threats must be assessed in the context of the entire application architecture."
- "Regular audits can help identify and mitigate vulnerabilities."
- "Community collaboration can improve identity security practices."
- "The complexity of cloud services has led to fragility in identity administration."
- "Managing identities as code allows better governance in cloud environments."
