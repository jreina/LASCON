# SUMMARY
Mike Ker discusses the modern threat landscape, covering threat actor motivations, the dark web, deep fakes, and AI-enabled threats.

# IDEAS:
- Threat actors are unified by a common goal of value creation, defined in various ways.
- A Yemeni threat actor attacked a U.S. airport due to perceived Israeli connections.
- Cybercrime as a service platforms allow criminals to monetize their skills easily and quickly.
- Less than 0.51% of cybercrime incidents are prosecuted, making it a low-risk activity for attackers.
- The rise of geopolitical tensions has increased cyber attacks on critical infrastructure.
- New technologies are often adopted without appropriate security measures, creating vulnerabilities.
- Attackers are pivoting to credential and identity abuse due to enhanced detection technologies.
- The dark web contains legitimate communities alongside criminal organizations, complicating its perception.
- Stolen credentials are often monetized within days on the dark web after data breaches.
- Users frequently reuse passwords across multiple accounts, increasing susceptibility to attacks.
- Deep fakes make it difficult to trust audio and video content, raising security concerns.
- Voice cloning can be created from minimal audio data, posing risks for voice verification systems.
- Deep fakes have been used in political campaigns to spread misinformation and disrupt elections.
- AI is being used by attackers to enhance their targeting and execution of cyber threats.
- Organizations must adapt their security measures to counter evolving AI-enabled threats.
- Continuous monitoring and user education are essential for maintaining cybersecurity effectiveness.

# INSIGHTS:
- Understanding attackers' motivations helps organizations develop better threat response strategies.
- The dark web's dual nature presents both risks and opportunities for cybersecurity professionals.
- Deep fakes represent a significant challenge for identity verification and trust in digital communications.
- AI is both a tool for attackers and a potential asset for improving cybersecurity defenses.
- Addressing user behavior, such as password reuse, is crucial for reducing security vulnerabilities.
- Organizations must adopt a proactive stance on emerging technologies to manage risks effectively.
- The evolving threat landscape requires continuous adaptation of security practices and policies.
- Engagement with business leaders is vital for understanding and managing AI-related risks.
- Implementing digital watermarking can help combat the misuse of synthetic media.
- Organizations need comprehensive incident response plans to address the risks posed by deep fakes.

# QUOTES:
- "All of these groups are unified by a similar idea and that is value creation."
- "Understanding what the value is that the attacker is trying to create helps us."
- "Less than 0.51% of cybercrime is prosecuted, making it a low-risk activity for attackers."
- "There’s a target-rich environment; there’s money to be made and very little risk."
- "The dark web is a high-risk environment for those who don't take the right precautions."
- "Deep fakes make it difficult to trust our ears and voices."
- "Voice verification systems are uniquely at risk for deep fake technology."
- "Organizations must adapt their security measures to counter evolving AI-enabled threats."
- "Continuous monitoring and user education are essential for maintaining cybersecurity effectiveness."
- "We need to engage with business leaders early to understand their use of AI."
- "Digital watermarking solutions can help limit the kinds of media that could be abused."
- "Machine learning and AI will help us on balance more than it will hurt us."
- "We need to have policies and plans in place to manage these evolving threats."
- "The evolving threat landscape requires continuous adaptation of security practices and policies."
- "Ultimately, we need to monitor and control effectiveness as threats evolve."

# HABITS:
- Regularly monitor dark web data for exposed credentials and tokens related to your organization.
- Train employees on recognizing and responding to phishing attacks effectively and promptly.
- Implement digital watermarking for media shared by the organization to combat misuse.
- Establish a process that inserts delays for large transactions to ensure thorough verification.
- Encourage a culture where employees feel comfortable questioning requests from authority figures.
- Conduct regular audits of AI systems used within the organization to identify biases.
- Develop incident response plans specifically addressing risks from deep fakes and synthetic content.
- Ensure all employees receive training on password integrity, not just rotation.
- Engage with business leaders to document and understand AI usage within the organization.
- Provide ongoing education about the latest threats and preventive measures to all staff.

# FACTS:
- The 2024 CrowdStrike Global Threat Report highlighted the motivations of various threat actors.
- Deep fakes have been documented in political campaigns, raising concerns about misinformation.
- In March 2023, authorities seized the Monopoly Market, arresting 300 individuals involved in trafficking.
- Passwords are reused by users across multiple accounts about two-thirds of the time.
- The 2021 FBI report indicated synthetic content could be used for business identity compromise.
- Stolen credentials can be sold on the dark web for varying prices depending on access level.
- Ransomware notes have cited fundraising needs related to geopolitical tensions as motivations.
- AI is enhancing phishing volumes by over 50% according to recent threat reports.
- Cybercrime as a service platforms offer criminal opportunities without requiring technical skills.
- Over 53% of adults share their voice online at least once a week, increasing cloning risks.
