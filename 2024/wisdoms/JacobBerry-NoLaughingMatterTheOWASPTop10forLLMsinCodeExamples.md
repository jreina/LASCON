# SUMMARY
Jacob Barry discusses security practices for generative AI applications, focusing on vulnerabilities and the OWASP Top 10 for large language models.

# IDEAS:
- Building security policies for generative AI is essential for protecting intellectual property and sensitive data.
- Prompt injection can lead to arbitrary code execution if input is not sanitized properly.
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLM applications by providing context from enterprise knowledge bases.
- Effective input sanitization is crucial to prevent potential security breaches in AI applications.
- Excessive agency occurs when AI applications can execute tasks without proper user oversight or controls.
- Information leakage can happen when sensitive data is unintentionally exposed during LLM operations.
- The OWASP Top 10 for LLMs outlines critical vulnerabilities to address during application development.
- Training data poisoning can compromise the integrity of large language models if not managed properly.
- Human-in-the-loop methodologies can mitigate excessive agency in AI systems by ensuring human oversight.
- LLM applications should have robust access controls to prevent unauthorized data access.
- Generative AI applications must adhere to established security practices similar to traditional software development.
- Libraries and tools exist to help implement effective input filtering and sanitization in AI applications.
- Utilizing vector stores for embeddings aids in retrieving relevant knowledge while maintaining security.
- Data classification is vital for organizing sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access.
- Secure coding practices are essential to mitigate risks associated with AI applications and their deployment.
- Continuous education and awareness around AI vulnerabilities are critical for developers and security professionals.
